🌟 A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization
Welcome to the A Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization!* This interactive project demonstrates the power of the A* algorithm in finding the shortest path in a grid-based environment. ✨

🎯 Features
Interactive Endpoint Selection: Click anywhere on the grid to set your endpoint and watch the algorithm in action!
Dynamic Pathfinding: Real-time visualization of the A* algorithm's decision-making process.
📜 Instructions
Launch the Visualization: Open the following link in your preferred browser: mertbildirici1.github.io/AStar
Set the Endpoint: Click anywhere on the grid to set your endpoint. The algorithm will start calculating the shortest path immediately.
Watch the Magic Happen: Observe the pathfinding process, and once the endpoint is found, a message will be displayed on the screen.
🌐 Technologies Used
p5.js: A JavaScript library for creative coding, making it easy to work with the canvas element.
JavaScript: The core language used for implementing the A* algorithm and interactive features.
